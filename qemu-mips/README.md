This is experimental, community-supported port for MIPS emulation as
provided by QEMU (http://qemu.org).

The purposes of this port are to enable:

1. Continuous integration
    - run tests agains architecture-specific parts of code base
2. Experimentation
    - simulation & prototyping of anything that has architecture-specific
      code
    - exploring instruction set in terms of optimising some part of
      MicroPython or a module
3. Streamlined debugging
    - no need for JTAG or even an MCU chip itself
    - no need to use OpenOCD or anything else that might slow down the
      process in terms of plugging things together, pressing buttons, etc.

This port has only been tested with the Codesourcery toolchain.
